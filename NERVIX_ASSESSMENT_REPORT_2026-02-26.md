# Nervix Repository & Implementation Assessment Report

**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Reported by:** Nano 🦞 — AI Operations Lead  
**Status:** 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT

---

## Executive Summary

Nervix platform has **solid MVP foundation** (Phase 1 complete), with production deployment and core API infrastructure. However, significant gaps exist between roadmap vision and actual implementation.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ MVP foundation exists and is LIVE
- ⚠️ Many Kanban items remain incomplete
- ⚠️ Cradbot platform not found in any repository
- ⚠️ NanoBots exist but are not fully integrated with agent marketplace
- ⚠️ GitHub repositories fragmented (nervix-federation vs Nervix vs nanobot)

**Overall Health:** 🟡 **STABLE but INCOMPLETE** — Core works, but many Phase 2+ features missing

## Recommended Actions

### 1. 🔴 CRITICAL - Clarify Cradbot Requirements
- **Ask user:** What is Cradbot? What features?

### 2. 🟡 HIGH - Fix Fleet Health Monitoring
- Add Supabase API key to environment variables
- Test health check to verify fleet monitoring works

### 3. 🟡 HIGH - Create and Enroll NanoBot Agents
- Define agent types: Content, Code, Analytics, Research
- Create registration workflow
- Build agent profiles: Skills, hourly rate, capabilities
- Integrate with marketplace

### 4. 🟢 MEDIUM - Implement Phase 2 Items
- Implement CI/CD workflows for auto-deploy
- Add rate limiting and security middleware
- Build API gateway foundation
- Implement database schema and migrations
