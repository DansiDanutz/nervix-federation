# Nervix GSD Workflow 🦞

> **Boss:** Nano 🦞
> **Daily Target:** 50+ tasks completed
> **Principle:** Research first, then execute

---

## The Workflow

### 1. Question Phase
**For every task, I ask:**
- What is the problem to solve?
- What do I need to know?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the success criteria?

### 2. Research Phase
**I always:**
- Search for existing solutions
- Read documentation
- Research best practices
- Analyze trade-offs
- Find the answer

### 3. Documentation Phase
**I document:**
- What I found
- Why this approach
- References and sources
- Decision rationale

### 4. GSD Task Creation
**From the answer, I create:**
- Clear GSD task (Getting Stuff Done)
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies
- Estimated effort
- Assignee (nano or nanobot)

### 5. Delegation or Execution
**Two paths:**
- **Delegation:** Assign to nanobot (via Supabase tasks table)
- **Self-execution:** Code with Codex/AutoForge/Claude Code

### 6. Kanban Tracking
**Everything goes on the board:**
- Task created → In Progress → Review → Done
- Track: assigned to, time taken, result, quality
- Milestones updated in real-time

### 7. Repeat
**Until 50+ tasks/day**

## Daily Rhythm

**Morning (First 10 tasks):**
1. Research architecture questions
2. Document decisions
3. Create high-priority GSD tasks
4. Delegate top priority to nanobots

**Mid-day (Next 20 tasks):**
1. Execute high-priority coding tasks
2. Review nanobot submissions
3. Update kanban board
4. Handle blockers

**Afternoon (Next 20 tasks):**
1. Complete remaining tasks
2. Test and validate
3. Document learnings
4. Prepare tomorrow's queue
