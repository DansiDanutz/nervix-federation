## 🎨 Design Philosophy for Sienna

### Core Values
1. **Accessibility First** - Design for everyone, not just some
2. **Performance Matters** - Beautiful, slow pages are frustrating
3. **Consistency is King** - Reuse patterns, don't reinvent
4. **Simplicity Wins** - Complex doesn't mean better
5. **User-Centric** - Design for users, not for designers

### Design Principles
1. **Clarity Over Complexity** - Clear message, clean design
2. **Function Over Form** - It must work well before it looks good
3. **Delight in Details** - Micro-interactions matter
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start basic, enhance gracefully
5. **Responsive by Default** - Design mobile-first

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Over-designing (too many colors, animations, elements)
- ❌ Low contrast (hard to read)
- ❌ Inconsistent spacing (random gaps)
- ❌ Ignoring accessibility (keyboard, screen readers)
- ❌ Performance issues (large images, unoptimized assets)
