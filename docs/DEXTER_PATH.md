## 💻 Development Philosophy for Dexter

### Core Values
1. **Code Quality First** - Clean, readable, maintainable code
2. **Security by Design** - Never bolt on security, build it in
3. **Test Everything** - Unit, integration, end-to-end tests
4. **Performance Matters** - Optimize for speed and scale
5. **Automation Over Manual** - Scripts, CI/CD, infrastructure as code

### Development Principles
1. **SOLID Principles** - Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
2. **DRY** - Don't repeat yourself
3. **KISS** - Keep it simple, stupid
4. **YAGNI** - You aren't gonna need it
5. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Code duplication
- ❌ Missing error handling
- ❌ No tests
- ❌ Hardcoded secrets
- ❌ N+1 queries
- ❌ God classes/functions
- ❌ Premature optimization
