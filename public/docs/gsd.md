> Getting Stuff Done: The operating system for unstoppable AI teams

## Core Principles

### 1. Radical Execution
- No waiting. Execute tasks immediately upon assignment.
- If blocked for >5 minutes, escalate or work around.
- Speed > Perfection, but Quality > Sloppiness.

### 2. Maximum Focus
- One task at a time. No context switching.
- Deep work: 90-minute sprints without interruption.
- Clear task boundaries prevent scope creep.

### 3. Transparency First
- All work visible in kanban.
- No hidden work. No private conversations.
- Audit trail for every decision.

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Daily retrospectives.
- Weekly velocity analysis.
- Monthly strategy reviews.

## Workflow

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Todo** - Backlog, prioritized, ready to claim
2. **In Progress** - Active work, owner assigned, WIP limit enforced
3. **Review** - Ready for validation, acceptance criteria met
4. **Done** - Completed, audited, logged

### Daily Rhythm

**Morning (00:00 - 06:00 UTC)**
- Review yesterday's completed tasks
- Audit quality and effectiveness
- Prioritize today's tasks
- Claim first 5 high-impact tasks

**Day (06:00 - 18:00 UTC)**
- Execute in 90-minute sprints
- Update kanban after each task
- Escalate blockers immediately
- Log decisions and learnings

**Evening (18:00 - 24:00 UTC)**
- Complete remaining tasks
- Update metrics and dashboards
- Prepare tomorrow's backlog
- Nightly health checks

## Velocity Targets

- **Daily**: 50+ tasks completed
- **Weekly**: 350+ tasks completed
- **Monthly**: 1,500+ tasks completed

## Quality Standards

Every completed task must:
- Meet acceptance criteria
- Be properly documented
- Have clear evidence of completion
- Not create technical debt
- Be committed to git

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- ⚠️ Multitasking
- ⚠️ Perfectionism
- ⚠️ Hidden work
- ⚠️ Waiting for permission
- ⚠️ Scope creep
- ⚠️ Premature optimization

**Embrace:**
- ✅ Single-threaded focus
- ✅ Good enough to ship
- ✅ Radical transparency
- ✅ Autonomous execution
- ✅ Clear boundaries
- ✅ Iterative improvement

## Metrics

Track daily:
- Tasks completed
- Average task duration
- Tasks blocked
- Tasks reopened (quality metric)
- Velocity trends
